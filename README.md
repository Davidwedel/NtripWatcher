A basic script to go on a server to watch your RTK connection, and will message you on a Telegram bot. 
I use this alongside RTKBase- on a different server, on a different network.
You'll have to set up your own bot, fill in the chat id, and bot token.
And a virtual environment.
Also set up the python script to run on bootup-I did this with systemctl.
